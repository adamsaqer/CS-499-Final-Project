## Code Review Video
Before diving into enhancements, I conducted a thorough code review of my initial artifacts to identify strengths and weaknesses. This process was essential for planning effective improvements and ensuring that the projects align with industry best practices. You can watch my detailed Code Review on YouTube, where I walk through the codebase and discuss planned enhancements: [CS499 Code Review Video](https://youtube.com/your-video-link). 

The code review helped establish a collaborative environment for feedback (Course Outcome 1) and sharpened my ability to communicate technical details orally (Course Outcome 2). It set the stage for the enhancement narratives below, each of which reflects on how the changes meet specific course outcomes.

## Course Outcomes Addressed
This capstone project demonstrates mastery of the five CS 499 course outcomes through the completion of the enhancements and supporting activities:

### Course Outcome 1: 
**Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.**

**How it's met:** I facilitated collaboration through code reviews and documentation. By inviting feedback and iterating on suggestions, I built an inclusive development process. The Code Review video and this README itself are products of clear communication aimed at diverse stakeholders, enabling others (developers, instructors, even non-technical reviewers) to engage with and contribute to the project.

### Course Outcome 2: 
**Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.**

**How it's met:** This README is crafted as a professional technical document, with careful attention to structure and clarity. I have presented complex technical enhancements in an accessible way using visuals like checklists, tables, and code snippets. The Code Review video further exemplifies professional oral communication, explaining the codebase in a coherent and audience-friendly manner.

### Course Outcome 3: 
**Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.**

**How it's met:** Each enhancement involved analyzing the problem and choosing appropriate algorithms and data structures. For example, in the Algorithms & Data Structures enhancement, I used efficient collections (ArrayList, HashSet) and algorithms for searching and validation (preventing duplicate entries, sorting outputs) to solve the requirements. I discuss the trade-offs of these choices in the narratives, ensuring the solution is both optimal and maintainable.

### Course Outcome 4: 
**Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.**

**How it's met:** I utilized a variety of tools and techniques across the projects: version control (Git), file I/O for data persistence, object-oriented design principles, and testing frameworks. In the Software Design & Engineering artifact, for instance, I implemented file persistence (AnimalFileHandler.java) to deliver value in a real-world scenario where data should persist between sessions. By integrating new features like monkey management into an existing codebase, I showed adaptability and innovative problem solving beyond the original project scope.

### Course Outcome 5: 
**Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.**

**How it's met:** Security considerations were paramount in my enhancements. I validated user inputs (e.g., restricting monkey species to allowed values, ensuring no empty names) to prevent misuse or corrupted data. In the Databases enhancement, I removed hard-coded credentials and implemented parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. I also tested the system against invalid inputs and edge cases to anticipate potential exploits. These steps demonstrate a proactive approach to security, aligning with industry standards for protecting data and resources.

Each of the following enhancement narratives will detail the specific artifact improved, the modifications made, the outcomes addressed by those modifications, and a reflection on the learning and challenges encountered.

## Enhancement One: Software Design & Engineering

### Artifact Description
For the Software Design & Engineering category, I selected the Rescue Animal Management System – a Java console application originally developed in SNHU IT-145 (Introduction to Software Development). This program manages a list of rescue animals (initially only dogs) for an international rescue organization. Users can intake new animals, reserve animals for service, and print reports of animals. 

The original artifact consisted of several classes (RescueAnimal, Dog, Driver, etc.) forming a basic menu-driven system to track dogs in training. The key files in this artifact include:

- `RescueAnimal.java` – a base class defining common attributes like name, age, training status, etc.
- `Dog.java` – a subclass of RescueAnimal adding the breed attribute for dogs.
- `Driver.java` – the main class providing a text-based menu interface to interact with the system (intake animals, reserve, print lists).

*(Originally, the system did not manage monkeys or persist data to a file.)*

### Enhancements Made
I enhanced this artifact to improve its design, functionality, and maintainability:

1. **Introduced Monkey Subclass**: Added a new subclass `Monkey.java` extending RescueAnimal to manage rescue monkeys in addition to dogs. This included new attributes (species, tail length, height, body length) and validation against a list of allowed monkey species.

2. **Refactored Menu and Input Validation**: Improved the `Driver.java` menu system by handling invalid inputs more gracefully (ignoring empty inputs, standardizing selection with toLowerCase). Added checks for duplicate animal names using a HashSet (`animalNames`) to ensure uniqueness across dogs and monkeys. For example, before adding a new animal, the system checks if the name already exists, preventing duplicate entries:

```java
if (animalNames.contains(name.toLowerCase())) {
    System.out.println("This animal name already exists in the system. Intake aborted.");
    return;
}
```

3. **Data Persistence with File Handling**: Implemented an `AnimalFileHandler.java` utility class to save and load animal records to a text file (`animals.txt`). Upon program start, the system loads existing animals from the file, and upon exit, it saves all current animals. This required designing a file format (CSV-like lines) and parsing logic. Now the application can persist data between runs, which is a significant real-world improvement.

4. **Code Organization and Comments**: Cleaned up code formatting and added JavaDoc comments for clarity and maintainability. Each public method and class now has documentation explaining its purpose. This makes the code more understandable for future collaborators or evaluators.

### Course Outcomes Met
- **Outcome 1 (Collaboration)**: The code review and subsequent enhancements fostered a collaborative approach. By structuring the code for readability and adding comments, I made it easier for others to understand and contribute. The use of a common data file (`animals.txt`) also means multiple team members can share and review data entries, supporting collaborative decision-making on the dataset.

- **Outcome 2 (Communication)**: The improved commenting and the structured README documentation of this system demonstrate clear written communication. The console prompts in `Driver.java` were refined to be user-friendly and unambiguous, ensuring the interface communicates effectively with end-users.

- **Outcome 3 (Algorithms & Standards)**: Using collections like ArrayList for animal storage and HashSet for name uniqueness reflects algorithmic thinking and adherence to best practices (e.g., O(1) average lookups for duplicates with a hash set). I evaluated trade-offs such as keeping two lists (dogs and monkeys) versus one unified list of animals – ultimately choosing separate lists for type-specific handling, which simplifies certain operations but requires a bit more code when printing all animals.

- **Outcome 4 (Techniques & Tools)**: Integration of file I/O for data persistence is an example of using well-founded tools (Java FileWriter/Scanner) to add value. It transforms the project from a transient demo into a practical application. Additionally, enhancing the design to accommodate new animal types without altering existing code (Open-Closed Principle) showcases a software engineering best practice.

- **Outcome 5 (Security Mindset)**: I incorporated input validation extensively. For example, when adding a monkey, the species must be one of the allowed types; otherwise the intake is aborted with a message. This prevents misuse (like someone trying to add an unsupported animal type) and ensures data integrity. Also, by using text file storage carefully (and informing the user if no file is found, then creating one), I avoid crashes or undefined behavior, which is a fundamental part of secure software design (robustness against unexpected states).

### Reflection
This enhancement process taught me valuable lessons in software design. Initially, the system was limited and somewhat rigid. By extending it with a new subclass, I experienced the power of object-oriented design – adding new functionality without modifying the core logic heavily. It reinforced my understanding of inheritance and polymorphism, as the `printAnimals()` function, for instance, can handle both dogs and monkeys seamlessly after the enhancement. 

I faced challenges in ensuring backwards compatibility and data integrity. When introducing file loading, I had to consider what happens if the file is missing or corrupted. I implemented safe fails (like initializing with sample data or skipping bad lines) to make the system resilient. Debugging the file parsing was another challenge; it required carefully aligning the file format with the object constructors (`Dog` expects 10 parameters plus boolean, `Monkey` expects more) and handling conversion of strings to booleans for the reserved field. 

Incorporating feedback from the code review was crucial. One suggestion was to avoid duplicate code – I achieved this by writing helper methods and reusing validation logic for both dogs and monkeys where possible. Another piece of feedback was to improve user prompts and error messages, which I addressed to make the system more user-friendly (a part of good software design often overlooked in pure functionality). 

Overall, this enhancement solidified my confidence in modifying and scaling an existing codebase. It showed me how thoughtful design and engineering can turn a simple project into a more robust, real-world applicable software. The positive results—such as successfully saving and loading a list of animals and handling new requirements—demonstrate my growth in software development and readiness for professional projects.

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms & Data Structures

### Artifact Description
For the Algorithms & Data Structures category, I chose a project that emphasizes efficient data manipulation and algorithmic problem solving. This artifact was originally a Java-based slideshow application from CS 250 (Data Structures and Algorithms) which displayed a series of vacation destinations. The original version used basic arrays and manual indexing logic to cycle through images and descriptions. It was a straightforward GUI program with Next and Previous buttons to iterate through slides. 

Another interpretation of this category (and artifact) is the Rescue Animal Management System itself, evaluated from a data structures perspective. However, to diversify the portfolio, I focused on a distinct artifact. For context:

- The Vacation Slideshow program was a small Java Swing application showcasing data structure use (though limited in initial scope).

*(Note: The actual code files for this artifact are not included in this repository, as it was primarily a course assignment artifact. The focus here is on describing the enhancements made to it to demonstrate algorithmic proficiency.)*

### Enhancements Made
I improved the slideshow application in several ways to highlight efficient algorithms and data handling:

1. **Replaced Array with ArrayList**: The original slideshow stored slides in an array with a fixed size. I refactored it to use an ArrayList for dynamic slide management. This allows adding or removing slides without resizing arrays, and it demonstrates the use of the List interface for flexibility.

2. **Implemented Efficient Navigation Algorithm**: Instead of manually tracking an index and using multiple conditionals to wrap around the slideshow (start to end, end to start), I introduced a modular arithmetic approach. For example, when moving to the next slide:

```java
currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % slides.size();
showSlide(currentIndex);
```

This single-line update automatically wraps to the beginning after reaching the end, which is more elegant and less error-prone than if/else conditions.

3. **Sorting and Filtering Feature**: I added functionality to sort slides by destination name and to filter slides by region (e.g., Europe, Asia). This enhancement required implementing a sorting algorithm (using Java's `Collections.sort` with a custom Comparator for slide names) and filtering (streaming the list and collecting matches). These operations demonstrate algorithmic thinking and efficiency considerations (e.g., the cost of sorting vs. the benefit of organized output).

4. **Data Structure for Quick Search**: I included a search feature where a user can type a destination name and the program jumps to that slide. To make this efficient, I utilized a HashMap mapping destination names to their index in the list. This provides average O(1) lookup time to find a slide by name, a significant improvement over a naive linear search each time.

### Course Outcomes Met
- **Outcome 1 (Collaboration)**: I shared this improved design with classmates for feedback on usability and performance. Their insights (e.g., on making the search feature case-insensitive) were incorporated, mimicking a collaborative environment where multiple developers refine an algorithm.

- **Outcome 2 (Communication)**: Documentation was key for explaining these algorithmic enhancements. I wrote clear comments and even a short user guide on how to use the new sorting/filtering features. Communicating how and why the algorithms were chosen (such as explaining the modulo trick for navigation) was part of the project report, showcasing my ability to deliver technical content to an audience.

- **Outcome 3 (Algorithms & Standards)**: This enhancement is the centerpiece for Outcome 3. I applied algorithmic principles (search, sort, modular arithmetic) and data structure selection (ArrayList, HashMap) to optimize the solution. I also considered standard practices: using built-in libraries (`Collections.sort`) where appropriate instead of writing from scratch to reduce errors and improve maintainability.

- **Outcome 4 (Techniques & Tools)**: I used Java's Collections framework (a powerful tool in any developer's arsenal) in innovative ways for the slideshow context. Introducing data structures like HashMap for quick search is a creative solution that adds value for the user. It shows familiarity with standard tools and the ability to extend functionality meaningfully.

- **Outcome 5 (Security Mindset)**: Although a slideshow app has a limited security surface, I still followed best practices such as validating user input for search (ignoring empty queries) and not trusting user-provided data without checks. In a broader sense, this cautious approach to any input or operation is part of the security mindset – ensuring the program doesn't crash or behave unpredictably with unexpected input (like a search for a non-existent destination).

### Reflection
Working on this artifact deepened my understanding of how data structures impact software performance and capability. Initially, the slideshow was functional but inflexible. By using an ArrayList, I allowed the program to scale – for instance, loading slides from a file would be easier now, or changing the content without worrying about array bounds. The search and sort features transformed the project from a simple demo to a more interactive application, which was very rewarding. 

One challenge was maintaining synchronization between the data structure (list of slides) and the GUI state. After adding or removing slides, I had to ensure the currentIndex still pointed to a valid slide. This required careful updating and some defensive coding (e.g., if the current slide was removed, show the next one and adjust the index). Testing these edge cases taught me about the importance of thinking through how algorithms handle dynamic data. 

Another interesting problem was the efficiency of filtering. I initially implemented filtering by creating a new list every time the user selected a filter criterion. This worked, but I noticed a slight delay when the list was large. I then improved it by keeping an indexed cache of categories to avoid filtering from scratch each time. This might be overkill for a small app, but it was a valuable exercise in optimization and considering trade-offs (memory for speed). 

In summary, this artifact's enhancement highlighted the power of choosing the right algorithm or data structure for the task. Even a simple project can greatly benefit from classic computer science principles. I learned that often the structure of data and flow of control can be refined to make a program more elegant, efficient, and easy to use. These lessons are directly applicable to any software development endeavor, where performance and clarity are paramount.

## Enhancement Three: Databases

### Artifact Description
In the Databases category, I focused on a project that involves storing, retrieving, and displaying data from a persistent store. My chosen artifact for enhancement is a Database and Dashboard system originally from CS 340 (Client/Server Development) and augmented with concepts from CS 499. The baseline project was a MongoDB-backed data dashboard for animal data (inspired by a rescue organization dataset). The original system allowed basic CRUD operations through a Python module and displayed data via a simple web dashboard. 

For the capstone, I conceptualized integrating this with the Rescue Animal system data, demonstrating how the console application could be extended into a full-stack solution:

- The data (animals) would be stored in a database instead of (or in addition to) a flat file.
- A front-end (or dashboard) would present this data to users with charts and tables.
- Security controls would be put in place for database access.

*(Note: This is a high-level description, as setting up a full web dashboard is beyond the scope of this README format. The emphasis is on the enhancements applied to the data handling and security of the database portion.)*

### Enhancements Made
I implemented and envisioned several enhancements to demonstrate database proficiency and secure data handling:

1. **Migration to SQLite (Relational Database)**: To simplify deployment (no external servers required for this portfolio demonstration), I migrated the data storage from MongoDB to an SQLite database. I wrote a Python script that reads the `animals.txt` (from the Software Engineering artifact) and populates an SQLite database with two tables: dogs and monkeys. This showcases my ability to work with SQL and integrate it with existing data.

2. **CRUD Python Module**: I enhanced the Python module that interacts with the database by adding functions to update and delete records (the original had create and read only). This module, for example, has functions like `get_available_animals()` to retrieve all animals that are "in service" and not reserved, combining data from both tables with an SQL JOIN. It also uses parameterized queries:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE name = ?", (name,))
```

to prevent SQL injection, which is a critical security improvement.

3. **Secure Credential Handling**: In the scenario where a web dashboard or an API is used, I removed any hard-coded database credentials. Instead, the module reads from a secure config file or environment variables. Although SQLite doesn't require a username/password by default, this simulates best practices for databases (and was directly applied when using MongoDB earlier, replacing hard-coded connection strings with config-driven ones).

4. **Data Visualization Dashboard**: On the front-end side, I prototyped a simple HTML/JavaScript dashboard (screenshots attached in the repository) that reads from the Python API and displays information like:
   - Total number of animals by type.
   - A table of all available (in-service & not reserved) animals.
   - Charts showing distribution of training status.

These visual elements make the data more accessible to stakeholders who might not want to run a console app. The enhancement here is integrating the back-end data with a front-end visualization, demonstrating full-stack capability.

5. **Additional Data Attributes**: I expanded the dataset to include more attributes relevant for reporting, for example, an age distribution chart or an indicator if an animal has any medical limitations. This required altering the database schema and ensuring all layers (data insertion, retrieval, display) handle the new attribute. It simulates a real-world need to evolve a database as requirements grow.

### Course Outcomes Met
- **Outcome 1 (Collaboration)**: By moving to a database and providing a dashboard, I enabled a more collaborative environment. Multiple users can view and even input data (if extended) concurrently. This structure allows diverse roles – from data analysts to rescue coordinators – to collaborate using the same data source. The enhancements were informed by feedback from potential "stakeholders" (peers acting as end-users), ensuring the system supports organizational decision-making (e.g., deciding how many animals can be deployed based on availability data).

- **Outcome 2 (Communication)**: The dashboard is a visual communication tool presenting the data in charts and tables, which is crucial for non-technical stakeholders. Additionally, I wrote a README section (in the project repo) for setting up the database and running the dashboard, adapting the communication to be clear for those who might not be familiar with the code. This shows my ability to deliver technical information in visual and written form appropriately.

- **Outcome 3 (Algorithms & Standards)**: Interacting with a database efficiently requires understanding algorithms, especially for querying (using indexes, query optimization) and data processing. I ensured that queries are optimized (for example, selecting only necessary columns for reports) and followed standards like Third Normal Form (3NF) for the relational schema to avoid anomalies. When combining dogs and monkeys for a unified report, I carefully designed the query algorithm to union the results while preserving performance.

- **Outcome 4 (Techniques & Tools)**: This enhancement demonstrates the use of multiple tools: a SQL database, Python for server-side logic, and web technologies (HTML/JS) for the front-end. Switching from MongoDB to SQLite also shows adaptability with different database technologies. I used SQLite Manager tools to inspect the database and Chart.js (a JavaScript library) for creating charts. Employing these tools effectively showcases my capability to implement solutions that meet industry goals, such as data-driven decision support systems.

- **Outcome 5 (Security Mindset)**: Security was at the forefront of this enhancement:
  - All database queries in the Python module use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.
  - The module enforces least privilege; for instance, if a user role was just for viewing data, it would only be granted SELECT permissions.
  - I removed hard-coded connection strings, which could leak sensitive info, and instead used configuration management.
  - On the front-end, if this were deployed, I would implement authentication for the dashboard to ensure only authorized personnel see the rescue animal data. This forward-thinking approach is part of a security mindset, anticipating how the system could be misused and protecting against it.

Additionally, I considered data privacy: while our dataset is not personal in nature, if it were, we would need to mask or anonymize certain fields. I included a concept of field masking for demonstration (e.g., obscuring any confidential notes about the animals when displayed publicly).

### Reflection
Enhancing a project in the database domain highlighted for me the importance of data architecture and security. One of the biggest lessons was how a well-structured database can drastically improve the capabilities of an application. By moving data to SQLite, I enabled complex queries that would be cumbersome in the flat file approach. For example, generating a list of available animals of both types is just a single SQL query now, whereas in the Java console version it required iterating through two lists and applying logic. 

A challenge I encountered was maintaining data consistency between the Java application and the new database. I had to decide how to keep them in sync. In a real-world scenario, we might refactor the Java app to use the database directly (perhaps via JDBC). I partially did this by creating a plan for a unified system, but for the scope of this portfolio, I kept them as separate components sharing the `animals.txt` as a bridge (the Python script reads from it). This is a bit of technical debt, but it allowed demonstration of database skills without rewriting the entire Java app to interface with SQL. 

Security improvements were both necessary and enlightening. When reviewing my original CS 340 project code, I noticed that I had left a MongoDB connection string with a password in plain text. This capstone was an opportunity to correct that and learn better practices. I implemented reading from environment variables in Python, which is something I hadn't done before – it was satisfying to see it work and know that I'd elevated the professionalism of the code. 

Finally, building the dashboard gave me a taste of full-stack development. Seeing data flow from a database to a Python service to an interactive chart in a browser was very rewarding. It tied together many skills: database design, API design, and front-end visualization. The positive feedback from peers on how informative the dashboard was reinforced the value of presenting data in multiple forms for different audiences. 

In conclusion, the database enhancement not only demonstrates technical proficiency in data management but also shows my growth in thinking about systems as a whole – considering how backend and frontend connect and how to safeguard the entire pipeline of data. It was a fitting capstone to the project, bringing together elements of software engineering, algorithms, and data in one cohesive narrative.
