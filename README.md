## 🌟 Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU has been more than just a series of assignments—it’s been a journey of technical growth and personal discovery. Coming from an operations management background, I brought leadership and process optimization skills into the program. But what I’ve gained here is the ability to **design, build, and optimize software** that solves real-world problems.

I now understand core areas of **object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithm design, secure coding, and file persistence**. One of my proudest achievements was learning how to combine technical skill with **user-centered thinking**, making tools that are both powerful and intuitive.

The ePortfolio you’re viewing represents a transformation. I took functional code and turned it into modular, maintainable, and scalable software. From **collaborating in code reviews** to implementing **secure file handling with JSON**, I’ve grown as both a developer and a team member.

### 🚀 Career Goals
I’m pursuing a role in **software engineering or project management**, aiming to lead and contribute to impactful solutions. This portfolio showcases real growth in technical depth, design thinking, and collaborative communication—skills I’m confident to carry into my next chapter.

## 🛠️ Enhancement Narrative #1: Software Design & Engineering

### 📌 Artifact: Rescue Animal System (Java)
Originally, this was a basic command-line program tracking rescue animals. It lacked clean class structures and reused a lot of input code, making updates difficult.

### 🔧 Enhancements:
- Refactored code to **modularize input** logic
- Implemented **robust validation**
- Enhanced clarity and UX of menus
- Improved **inheritance and abstraction** in the `RescueAnimal`, `Dog`, and `Monkey` classes  
- Used **OOP best practices** to improve reusability

### ✅ Course Outcomes:
- Designed professional-quality written and visual code
- Demonstrated well-founded software engineering techniques
- Applied object-oriented design for maintainable code

### 🧠 Reflection:
I learned how to **redesign and refactor** a functional system into one that is easier to manage and extend. Clean structure matters—it’s not just about working code, it’s about scalable, logical systems.

## ⚙️ Enhancement Narrative #2: Algorithms & Data Structures

### 📌 Artifact: Animal Intake & Reservation Logic
The original logic manually looped through lists without much structure. Searches and validations were basic and error-prone.

### 🔧 Enhancements:
- Added **normalized string comparisons** and better search filtering
- Improved **conditional logic** to handle species, status, and reservations
- Reduced complexity by reusing methods and eliminating redundancy
- Focused on **input-driven flow** improvements and validations

### ✅ Course Outcomes:
- Designed efficient algorithms and logic structures
- Applied reasoning to streamline processes
- Implemented user-friendly validation and search algorithms

### 🧠 Reflection:
Even without advanced data structures, the logic improvements taught me that **clear thinking beats complexity**. It’s about anticipating user behavior, streamlining flows, and minimizing room for error.

## 🗃️ Enhancement Narrative #3: Databases

### 📌 Artifact: File Persistence Using JSON
Previously, there was **no data persistence**—restarting the app wiped all data. This didn’t reflect real-world expectations for data handling.

### 🔧 Enhancements:
- Created `AnimalFileHandler` to handle **JSON read/write operations**
- All animals are loaded from and saved to `animals.txt`
- Implemented automatic save after every intake or update
- Built a **simple, testable, and extendable system** that simulates a lightweight database

### ✅ Course Outcomes:
- Applied database design and data handling principles
- Delivered value through persistent data storage
- Demonstrated real-world file I/O techniques

### 🧠 Reflection:
This taught me **how persistence changes everything**. It brought realism to the app and introduced new design challenges. Working with file storage helped me simulate backend logic and consider security and integrity of data.

## ✅ Summary

This ePortfolio demonstrates my growth across all core areas of computer science:

- 🧱 **Software Design & Engineering** → Clean code, modular structure, solid OOP  
- 🧠 **Algorithms & Data Structures** → Smart logic, usability-focused search & validation  
- 🗂 **Databases** → Real-world data persistence with JSON and file I/O  

I'm proud of this project—not just for how it works, but for how much I’ve learned refining it. I'm ready to bring this skillset to the next level, whether that’s in software engineering, project management, or both.
